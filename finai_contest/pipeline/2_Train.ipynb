    "The agent is active in a world, which is the environment. It observe its current condition as a **state**, and is allowed to do certain **actions**. After the agent execute an action, it will arrive at a new state. At the same time, the environment will have feedback to the agent called **reward**, a numerical signal that tells how good or bad the new state is. As the figure above, agent and environment will keep doing this interaction.\n",
